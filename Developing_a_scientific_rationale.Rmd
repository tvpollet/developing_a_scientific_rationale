## Outline of today.

* Intro.

* Identifying a topic.

* Formulating a research question.

* Summary.

We'll use '[zeetings](www.zeetings.com/tvpollet)' to make it a bit more interactive. Go to [www.zeetings.com/tvpollet](www.zeetings.com/tvpollet) for the interactive bit.

--> Goal for today: give you some strategies for developing a rationale.

## Who am I... ?

* I teach [Advanced Quantitative methods](https://tvpollet.github.io/PY0794). Also, I was the 'Director of Learning & Teaching: Experience' and taught the option course Research on Human Nature (PY0552).

--

* I am an interdisciplinary behavioural scientist and I have published [too many papers](https://tvpollet.github.io/papers). I work mostly on social relationships (friendships, loneliness, social networks, jealousy, attraction in romantic relationships), but have ventured out (e.g., research methodology, sex ratios, left-handedness, body image (height), personality, PTSD, 'cyberpsychology',...)

--

* Some of the things published are Bachelor projects (!) (needless to say that those students did fairly well.)

---
## Who are you?

So which of the following best describes your proposed interest (pick a word! e.g., addiction, cognition, personality).

**Zeetings Question**

```

---
## Why should this session matter to you?

* You have developed your skills in Year 2: Lab Skills Experience, Research Design, Data Collection/ Collation, Data Analyses, Report Writing, Lab Report Assessment.

--

* For the next 6 months, you will be applying all those skills in your final-year project.

--

* Some practical tips and some things from my own experience to help you.

```

---
## Meeting your supervisor.

* Have you met your supervisor? 

**Zeetings question**

--

* Arrange an appointment to discuss your project proposal.

--

* Aim to design a manageable, empirical study:

To discuss: 
  1. Still what you want to do? 
  2. Read the literature?
  3. Theory - hypothesis
  4. What is your research question?
  5. How will your method answer the question?


```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

---
## Identifying a topic (Kinmond, 2012: 26-ff).

* Derive research questions from the literature, instead of: 'armchair speculation' or anecdotal musing.

--

* Important to take account of the research that has already been conducted in the area. Do a thorough literature search!

--

* Avoid running the risk of investigating a research question which has been addressed and answered already! --> Some things are 'solved'!

---
## Read and synthesise the literature.

* Start with a paper you found interesting and work your way back. Who do they cite? Who cites them? 

* Google Scholar. Use other database such as 'Web of Science', 'EBSCO', 'Pubmed' (medical).

* Good keywords. 

* Ask a librarian! 

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/QVxeI5qhmlXAkqaAro/giphy.gif")
```

---
## Help!

You have looked and nothing 'relevant' is there.

* Are you super-lucky and did nobody ever look at your research question?

* Did you use a good combination of search terms?

* Discuss with your prospective supervisor, if you find a dearth of research in that area? (Is it... 'solved'? 'out of fashion'? 'bad(?) research'?) 

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/phJ6eMRFYI6CQ/giphy.gif")
```

---
## Evaluating the literature.

* Triage: useful, not useful, maybe useful.

--

* Look out for review papers: e.g., _Annual Review of 'X'_ , _Psychological Bulletin_, _Psychological Review_, _Clinical Psychology Review_ .  --> (Systematic) reviews and meta-analyses. 

--

* Use a reference manager to order your chaos. (Endnote; [Mendeley](www.mendeley.com); [Zotero](www.zotero.org))

--

* Make a [board](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pepe_silvia.jpg")
```

---
## The importance of replication.

* You found a study but it's not particularly good! (clues: smallish sample size, incredibly big effects,....)

--

* It is extremely valuable to replicate earlier published studies. Discuss with your supervisor - Do you think the findings of the original paper hold?

--

* So your question could just be: does this hold up?

```

---
## Example 1: Red laptops... .

* Social Psychological research: 'Red' is suggested to enhance attractiveness (e.g., [Elliot & Niesta, 2008](https://www.bryanburnham.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Elliot-Niesta-2008-JPSP-.pdf))

--

* In an extension, Lin (2014) found: _"Women carrying products in red only affected how men, but not women, perceived them."_

--

* Photo with woman holding a red laptop (vs. black, blue, or grey laptop) rated as significantly more attractive by the opposite gender.

```

---
## Replication.

Study 1 carried out by 2 MSc. students in the Netherlands (N= 273). 

--

To the best degree possible, we followed the original study,... .

--

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("violinplot_NL.png")
```

---
## Extending previous research: Finding clues... .

* Discussion: Often has useful things in it: look for the limitations / future directions section in a paper

--

* What has been missed?

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/l4pTibO1cY4d5aeyI/giphy.gif")
```

---
## Easy: Improved measurement.

* Often there is substantial mileage to be gained from testing the same thing but with a better measure. So, close to replication but with a twist. 

--

* For example, you found a study but it is using an unreliable measure. A clue could be the low reliability ( $\alpha$ ) of the measure.


```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

---
## Easy: Different population(s) / differences according to 'X'?

* In the example above, Dutch students instead of Chinese students,... .

--

* 'Moderators':  is the effect stronger for certain subgroups (e.g., gender, culture, sexual orientation, marital status, ... .)

--

* Could the effect be explained by a 'third variable'? 

--

* Example: [Regulatory focus and every day risk taking](https://sbe.vu.nl/nl/Images/reg_focus_jw_tcm257-240967.pdf). (More advanced read [this](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X))

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Hamstra_article.png")
```

**Zeetings question**

???
Mention 'prevention vs. promotion focus.'

---
## Easy - moderate: A different setting.

* Transpose to a different setting. Let's stick with risk taking for now,... . 

--

* An example from a (successful) Bachelor thesis project I supervised.

---
## An example: Gender differences in every day risk taking behaviour in traffic.

We had previously done studies in the Netherlands: we found men are more likely to take risk in traffic than women do ([Cobey et al., 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491301100206)).

--

For example, we observed using lights on one's bike and gender (N=555 cyclists).

## Bachelor project by O'Dowd.

Looking at unsafe crossing towards the metro station ('Jaywalking'), gender, and time of day (presence of daylight).

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

```

What do you think we found? **Zeetings Question.**

## More difficult: Testing competing predictions! I

* A critical test (Dunbar, 1995). 'Theory A' says 'X', but 'Theory B' says 'Y'. Can you design a study which will allow us to test between A and B? Or what type of tests allow you to find evidence

--

* An example by [Dunbar et al. (2002)](https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/139/5/article-p695_8.xml): Vigilance in human groups.

--

* People continuously evaluate their environment ('Vigilance'). The authors tested competing hypotheses ('predation', 'friend searching', 'mate search', 'mate guard').

## More difficult: Testing competing predictions! II

```

---
## Summary

* Do a thorough literature search!

* Do you 'trust' the finding? How can you improve the 'original' (measurement)?

* What is missing? Are there any potential confounds?

* Can you transpose the study to a different setting or different population?

* Does a competing theory suggest something else?
